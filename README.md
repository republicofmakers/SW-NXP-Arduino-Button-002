# SW-NXP-Arduino-Button-002

Here is simple test code to control a led with a button. I used Teensy 4.1.

Demonstration:

<img width="608" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfd1d233-a84f-4b7e-90de-710f79db5904" />

LED OFF

<img width="620" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e94f91ba-807c-4608-bb82-59cf37100beb" />

LED ON

Hope this helps you.
